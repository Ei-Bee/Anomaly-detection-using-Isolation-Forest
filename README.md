# Anomaly-detection-using-Isolation-Forest
Doing anomaly detection in network ttraffic using Isolation Forest 
Anomaly --  the data points that deviates from normal data point in some or another way.
Isolation Forest are tree based model or algorithm introduced by Fei Tony Liu and Zhi- Hua Zhou in 2008. It uses decision trees to efficiently isolate anomalies by randomly selecting features and splitting data based on threshold values (minimum and maximum values of the selected features). This approach is effective in quickly identifying outliers, making it well-suited for large datasets where anomalies are rare and distinct. It works best on high- dimensional data.
